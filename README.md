# Sum-of-Multiples-Calculator
A program that calculates the sum of the first N multiples of a given integer.

This program prompts the user to input an integer and the number of multiples to sum. 
It calculates the total by iterating through the range from 1 to the specified count, multiplying the input number by each integer in that range, 
and accumulating the results. The program also includes error handling to ensure that the user inputs valid integers, providing a message for invalid inputs.

Example: Sum of Multiples of 5
User Input:

Number: 5
Count: 10
Process:

The program will calculate the sum of the first 10 multiples of 5

Multiples Calculation:
1st multiple: 5×1=5
2nd multiple: 5×2=10
3rd multiple: 5×3=15
4th multiple: 5×4=20
5th multiple: 5×5=25
6th multiple: 5×6=30
7th multiple: 5×7=35
8th multiple: 5×8=40
9th multiple: 5×9=45
10th multiple: 5×10=50

Total Sum = 5+10+15+20+25+30+35+40+45+50
